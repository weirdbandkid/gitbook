# Discord RPC

## Clone the repo

You can clone the repo by doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/weirdbandkid/discordrpc.git
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: This will install in your current directory
{% endhint %}

Once you did that, edit the `index.js` file

Once that is done, do the following command:

```bash
cd discordrpc
node .
```

Now you are done! Check your Discord status to see it!
