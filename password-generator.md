# Password Generator

## _Installing_

{% hint style="danger" %}
You must have python installed to use this 
{% endhint %}

**Installing this is a fairly straight forward process:**

Just go to [this link](https://github.com/weirdbandkid-games/password-generator/releases/download/latest/Password_Gen_Installer_1.0.0.exe).

{% hint style="info" %}
 This will install in your `C:\Program File` Directory. If you don't want that, contact weirdbandkid. Or if you don't want the  `exe`, you don't have to.
{% endhint %}

This will create a shortcut on the desktop. Just double click that and your good to go!
